"Sugoi Nihongo" tries to help you memorise specific words which you encounter while studying Japanese, so you are not bothered with some predefined, startup words which you might already know and do not care about any more. But the app requires you to study on your own as it is only a container of your specific knowledge.

Not only can you store words, but also interesting sentences and grammar rules which are though to keep in mind all the time.

Enhance your Japanese knowledge with word quizzes (from your native language to Japanese and vice versa) and grammar exercises and keep practising.

I wish you good luck in mastering Japanese.
